I'm a Ph.D. student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology at the Department of computer science and engineering (HKUST, CSE), supervised by Prof. Lei Chen  starting from Aug 2018. Before my Ph.D. journey, I obtained my MS.c degree in Information Technology from HKUST and received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology.

My research interests include High-performance Blockchain/Distributed Database systems; Transaction Management Algorithms; and Approximation Algorithms;. I was a White hat (Certified by Wooyun).
